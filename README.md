# PINValidation
Simple and short program that asks user to enter a 4-digit PIN and allows access only if the entered PIN matches a pre-defined PIN.

The program prompts the user to enter a 4-digit PIN and compares the entered PIN with a valid PIN that is pre-defined in the code.
If the entered PIN is not the same as the valid PIN, the program prompts the user to enter the PIN again until the correct PIN is entered.
Once the correct PIN is entered, the program prints a message indicating that access has been granted.
